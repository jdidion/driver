Many programming competitions (e.g. Google Code Jam) use a common format for
problem input and output. The driver.Main class is an attempt to implement all
the common work involved in implementing solutions to these problems and add
some nice features on top - multithreading support, profiling and unit testing.
Here's an example of a minimal implementation:

from driver import Main

class ProblemA(Main):
    def __init__(self):
        Main.__init__(self, 'problemA')
            
    def parse_input(self, case_num, input_str):
        # parse input string and return it as structured data
            
    def solve(self, case_num, case):
        # solve the problem for the given input and return ther result
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    ProblemA().run()
